Keywords or methods, things that Ruby knows how to do.

How To Convert A String To Upper Or Lowercase In Ruby
Written by Michael Rode on Jul 21 2016
Ruby’s string class offers a few methods to change the case of a string.

Upcase
Upcase is used to capitalize every letter of a string.

“michael”.upcase
returns: MICHAEL

Downcase
Downcase is used to make every letter in a string lowercase.

“MICHAEL”.downcase
returns: michael

Capitalize
Another method on the string class is capitalize. This method capitalizes the first letter of a string while downcasing the remaining letters.

“mICHAel”.capitalize
returns: Michael

Titleize
Titleize capitalizes every word in a string. Remember you can only use this if you are working within the Rails framework (or just the ActiveSupport gem).

name = “jaKe JoNes”
name.titleize
returns: Jake Jones

These are just a few methods on the String class. I suggest you read through this documentation to get familiar with all of the methods on String.

Types of things we can store in variables:

strings
numbers
true and false
array (list of things)
object

Can the value of a greeting be a number?

greeting can be a string and use it, then number.

People think this makes Ruby bad.

Ruby is permissive of types.
